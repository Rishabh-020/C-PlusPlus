# üß† OOPS_CPP ‚Äì Object-Oriented Programming in C++

This folder demonstrates core **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts in **C++** through simple, focused code examples. Each file covers a specific topic, making it easy to understand and practice fundamental OOP principles.

## üìÇ File Overview

| Filename             | Topic                     | Description |
|----------------------|---------------------------|-------------|
| `constructor.cpp`    | **Constructors**           | Shows how to create and use default, parameterized, and copy constructors. |
| `FnPointer.cpp`       | **Function Pointers**      | Demonstrates how to declare, assign, and call functions using pointers. |
| `Inheritance.cpp`     | **Single Inheritance**     | Explains how a derived class can inherit from a single base class. |
| `Multilevel.cpp`      | **Multilevel Inheritance** | Illustrates inheritance across multiple class levels (e.g., A ‚Üí B ‚Üí C). |
| `MultipleInher.cpp`   | **Multiple Inheritance**   | Covers how a class can inherit from multiple base classes and resolve conflicts. |
| `one.cpp`             | **OOP Basics**             | Likely contains a simple class-object example or practice task. |
| `two.cpp`             | **OOP Practice**           | A continuation or variant of `one.cpp`, reinforcing key concepts. |
| `oopsVecotr.cpp`      | **Vectors with OOP**       | Combines C++ STL vectors with OOP‚Äîmanaging collections of objects. |
| `thisConstructor.cpp` | **`this` Pointer**         | Shows how the `this` keyword is used inside constructors and member functions. |

## üéØ Learning Goals

By exploring these files, you‚Äôll learn how to:

- Structure classes and use constructors
- Implement inheritance (single, multilevel, multiple)
- Understand function pointers in C++
- Work with `this` pointer to access current object
- Use **STL Vectors** in an object-oriented way

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Run

Use any C++ compiler like `g++` to compile and run each file individually:

```bash
g++ filename.cpp -o output
./output
